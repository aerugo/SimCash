# Advanced Policy Crisis Scenario
#
# NARRATIVE: "Next-Generation Cash Management Under Stress"
#
# This scenario demonstrates the latest policy system enhancements (Phases 3.3-4.5):
# - Bank-Level Budgets: Agents control release pace and prioritize counterparties
# - Collateral Auto-Withdraw Timers: Temporary liquidity boosts with automatic cleanup
# - State Registers: Policy micro-memory for cooldowns, counters, and mode switching
# - Adaptive Strategies: Banks adjust behavior based on memory and system state
#
# DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
# - Day 1: Normal operations - agents establish baseline behavior patterns
# - Day 2: Crisis - strategic stress tests new policy features under pressure
# - Day 3: Recovery - demonstrate adaptive memory-driven responses
# - Result: ~90-95% settlement rate with sophisticated policy responses
#
# KEY FEATURES DEMONSTRATED:
# - Budget management prevents queue flooding (Phase 3.3)
# - State registers enable cooldowns after burst releases (Phase 4.5)
# - Mode switching (aggressive/normal/conservative) based on liquidity (Phase 4.5)
# - Collateral timers provide temporary EOD boosts (Phase 3.4)
# - Counterparty prioritization for LSM coordination (Phase 3.3)
# - Release count tracking for throughput management (Phase 4.5)
#
# POLICY SHOWCASE:
# 1. METRO_CENTRAL: sophisticated_adaptive_bank.json
#    - Adaptive budgets based on queue pressure
#    - Cooldowns after large releases
#    - Collateral timers for EOD push
#
# 2. REGIONAL_TRUST: memory_driven_strategist.json
#    - Mode switching (aggressive/normal/conservative)
#    - Release counting to prevent bursts
#    - Memory-driven budget management
#
# 3. MOMENTUM_CAPITAL: smart_budget_manager.json
#    - Daily release targets
#    - Counterparty prioritization (CORRESPONDENT_HUB)
#    - Throughput-aware budget adjustment
#
# 4. CORRESPONDENT_HUB: sophisticated_adaptive_bank.json
#    - Same as METRO but with different parameters
#    - Demonstrates policy reusability

# ============================================================================
# EXPECTED ADVANCED POLICY BEHAVIORS
# ============================================================================
#
# DAY 1 BASELINE (Ticks 0-99):
# METRO_CENTRAL (sophisticated_adaptive_bank):
#   - Sets budgets at 35% of effective_liquidity when queue < 15
#   - No cooldowns yet (bank_state_cooldown = 0.0)
#   - Posts collateral only if queue1_liquidity_gap > min_buffer
#   - Expected: Smooth operations, occasional budget adjustments
#
# REGIONAL_TRUST (memory_driven_strategist):
#   - Starts in normal mode (bank_state_mode = 1.0)
#   - Switches to aggressive mode if liquidity > 80% of queue value
#   - No cooldowns yet (bank_state_cooldown = 0.0)
#   - Expected: Mode switches based on liquidity fluctuations
#
# MOMENTUM_CAPITAL (smart_budget_manager):
#   - Tracks releases against daily_release_target (30.0)
#   - Adjusts budget if behind target
#   - Prioritizes CORRESPONDENT_HUB in focus_cpty_list
#   - Expected: Steady throughput management
#
# CORRESPONDENT_HUB (sophisticated_adaptive_bank):
#   - Similar to METRO but 38% budget_multiplier
#   - Longer collateral timers (20 ticks)
#   - Expected: Slightly more aggressive than METRO
#
# DAY 2 CRISIS (Ticks 100-199):
# METRO_CENTRAL:
#   - Large queue (>15) triggers 50% budget increase
#   - Large releases likely trigger cooldown (bank_state_cooldown = 8-10)
#   - EOD (tick 180+) posts temporary collateral with 18-tick timer
#   - Cooldown prevents excessive releases during surge
#   - Expected: Controlled pace despite high pressure
#
# REGIONAL_TRUST:
#   - Collateral haircut (tick 120) likely switches to conservative mode (0.0)
#   - Conservative mode: only releases priority >= 7 with buffer
#   - Release bursts → cooldown (bank_state_cooldown = 12)
#   - Cooldown decrements each tick: 12 → 11 → 10 → ...
#   - Expected: Defensive posture, gradual recovery
#
# MOMENTUM_CAPITAL:
#   - Tracks falls behind daily_release_target
#   - Boosts budget to catch up with HUB focus
#   - EOD (tick 180+) aggressive budget (70% of liquidity + queue)
#   - Sets counterparty limits (max_per_cpty)
#   - Expected: Targeted throughput recovery
#
# CORRESPONDENT_HUB:
#   - High queue triggers larger budgets
#   - May enter cooldown after large bilateral settlement
#   - Posts large temporary collateral (~$30k) at EOD
#   - Timer ensures auto-withdrawal in early Day 3
#   - Expected: Active LSM participant with smart pacing
#
# DAY 3 RECOVERY (Ticks 200-299):
# METRO_CENTRAL:
#   - Cooldowns from Day 2 expire early in Day 3
#   - Collateral timers from late Day 2 auto-withdraw
#   - Returns to normal adaptive budgeting
#   - Expected: Full recovery with learned patterns
#
# REGIONAL_TRUST:
#   - Collateral restoration (tick 205) triggers mode switch
#   - Conservative (0.0) → Normal (1.0) → possibly Aggressive (2.0)
#   - Fresh release_count tracking starts
#   - May hit release_count_limit and re-enter cooldown
#   - Expected: Dynamic mode transitions
#
# MOMENTUM_CAPITAL:
#   - Assesses Day 3 daily_release_target (35.0)
#   - Adjusts budget based on Day 2 backlog
#   - May use aggressive EOD budget to clear queue
#   - Collateral timer withdrawals reduce costs
#   - Expected: Target-driven throughput
#
# CORRESPONDENT_HUB:
#   - Day 2 collateral timers (20 ticks) complete early Day 3
#   - Fresh budget cycles start
#   - Final cycle (ticks 240-244) tests recovered capacity
#   - Expected: Strong finish with full features
#
# THREE-DAY TOTALS:
# - State Register Events: 200-350 (cooldowns, mode switches, counters)
# - Budget Set Events: ~300 (1 per agent per tick when active)
# - Collateral Timer Events: 10-20 (temporary posts with auto-withdraw)
# - Memory-Driven Holds: 50-100 (due to cooldowns and mode constraints)
# - Average Settlement Rate: 90-95% (sophisticated but conservative)
# - Total LSM Operations: 40-80 (controlled by budget pacing)
# - Overdue Transactions: 3-8 (well-managed with urgency priority)
# - Total Costs: $6,000-$13,000 (higher than simple policies due to conservative pacing)
#
# KEY INSIGHTS:
#
# 1. BUDGET MANAGEMENT (Phase 3.3):
#    - Controls release pace to prevent queue flooding
#    - Counterparty focus enables LSM coordination
#    - Per-counterparty limits prevent concentration risk
#    - Observable in: BankBudgetSet events, BudgetExhausted holds
#
# 2. STATE REGISTERS (Phase 4.5):
#    - Cooldowns prevent repeated bursts (bank_state_cooldown)
#    - Mode switching adapts to liquidity (bank_state_mode)
#    - Release counting tracks throughput (bank_state_release_count)
#    - Observable in: StateRegisterSet events, mode-based decisions
#
# 3. COLLATERAL TIMERS (Phase 3.4):
#    - Temporary EOD boosts with automatic cleanup
#    - No manual tracking needed - fire-and-forget
#    - Reduces collateral opportunity costs
#    - Observable in: CollateralPost events with timer, auto-withdrawals
#
# 4. ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES:
#    - Policies learn from past behavior via memory
#    - Budget adjustments respond to queue pressure
#    - Mode switches enable multi-strategy operation
#    - Observable in: Changing decision patterns over time
#
# 5. COMPARATIVE PERFORMANCE:
#    - METRO & HUB: Similar behavior, different parameters
#    - REGIONAL: Most dynamic (3 modes + cooldowns)
#    - MOMENTUM: Most goal-oriented (daily targets)
#    - Observable in: Per-agent settlement rates and costs
