# Liquidity Saving Mechanisms (LSMs) in T2 RTGS (2023)

## Overview of LSM Features in T2

The new T2 RTGS system (launched March 2023) incorporates liquidity-saving mechanisms that optimize settlement of queued payments via **offsetting algorithms**. T2 supports both **bilateral** and **multilateral (cycle-based)** offsetting to reduce liquidity needs[\[1\]](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1089.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Multilateral%20offsetting%3A%20Offsetting%20payments,outstanding%20payment%20value%20is%20larger)[\[2\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/consolidation/profuse/shared/pdf/rtgs_urd_v3-0.en.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Payment%20orders%20on%20top,AVAILABLE%20LIQUIDITY%20AND%20BLOCKED%20ACCOUNTS%2FPARTIES). These algorithms identify sets of queued payment orders that can settle simultaneously (within the same second) so that participants can reuse incoming funds from those payments, minimizing net liquidity requirements[\[2\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/consolidation/profuse/shared/pdf/rtgs_urd_v3-0.en.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Payment%20orders%20on%20top,AVAILABLE%20LIQUIDITY%20AND%20BLOCKED%20ACCOUNTS%2FPARTIES)[\[3\]](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1089.pdf#:~:text=queue%20can%20done%20bilaterally%20or,Multilateral%20offsetting%20improves%20liquidity). Crucially, **T2 does not split or partially execute individual payment instructions** – each payment order is settled in full or not at all, even when included in an offsetting cycle[\[4\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/target2/profuse/nov_2019/shared/pdf/T2_UDFS_book_1_v13.01_20191025.pdf#:~:text=indica%02tor%20is%20not%20fulfilled,earmarking%20of%20payments%20for%20removal)[\[5\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/consolidation/profuse/shared/pdf/rtgs_urd_v3-0.en.pdf#:~:text=of%20liquidity%20and%20partial%20execution,transfer%20order%20shall%20be%20rejected). The LSMs instead achieve liquidity savings by smart matching of whole payments (possibly unequal in value) rather than by breaking a single payment into pieces.

## Bilateral Offsetting vs. Partial Payment Splitting

**Bilateral offsetting** in T2 occurs when two participants have payments queued to each other. T2’s logic will attempt to settle them simultaneously if doing so will reduce the liquidity shortfall. For example, if Bank A has an outgoing payment to Bank B that cannot settle due to insufficient funds, the system checks if Bank B has any queued payment to Bank A that could offset it[\[6\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/consolidation/profuse/shared/pdf/rtgs_urd_v3-0.en.pdf#:~:text=Name%20Exception%20for%20settlement%20attempt,are%20not%20fulfilled%2C%20RTGS%20shall). If a counter-payment exists, T2 will attempt to settle **both** payments together, thereby **offsetting** their values and reducing the net liquidity needed. This is done even if the two payments are not exactly equal – any difference (net debit) must be covered by the owing bank’s available balance or credit line[\[7\]](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1089.pdf#:~:text=20Where%20netting%20is%20possible%2C%20and,cover%20its%20net%20outstanding%20obligation). Importantly, T2 **does not allow partial settlement of a single payment**: the full amount of each instruction must be settled as a whole. If one bank’s payment is larger than the other’s, the larger payment will only settle if the net difference can be funded; the system will not split the payment or settle it partially[\[4\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/target2/profuse/nov_2019/shared/pdf/T2_UDFS_book_1_v13.01_20191025.pdf#:~:text=indica%02tor%20is%20not%20fulfilled,earmarking%20of%20payments%20for%20removal). In practice, this means **all LSM matching uses whole payment amounts**. Either the two offsetting payments settle in full (with the net imbalance paid from liquidity), or neither settles. There is **no splitting of one order into smaller portions** for separate settlement attempts[\[4\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/target2/profuse/nov_2019/shared/pdf/T2_UDFS_book_1_v13.01_20191025.pdf#:~:text=indica%02tor%20is%20not%20fulfilled,earmarking%20of%20payments%20for%20removal). For instance, if A owes B €100 and B owes A €80, T2’s bilateral offset algorithm can pair them so that both €100 and €80 settle at once, but only if A has at least €20 liquidity to cover the net difference – otherwise, no partial execution occurs and both remain queued[\[7\]](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1089.pdf#:~:text=20Where%20netting%20is%20possible%2C%20and,cover%20its%20net%20outstanding%20obligation).

**Key points:**  
\- T2 participants can assign priorities and use _“offsetting with liquidity increase”_ features: if a queued payment can potentially be settled by offsetting it against an incoming payment from the beneficiary, T2 will attempt it even if normal FIFO conditions aren’t met[\[6\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/consolidation/profuse/shared/pdf/rtgs_urd_v3-0.en.pdf#:~:text=Name%20Exception%20for%20settlement%20attempt,are%20not%20fulfilled%2C%20RTGS%20shall). This includes checking the top of the receiver’s queue (_“offsetting position 1”_) or deeper queued payments that would bring liquidity (_“extended offsetting”_)[\[2\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/consolidation/profuse/shared/pdf/rtgs_urd_v3-0.en.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Payment%20orders%20on%20top,AVAILABLE%20LIQUIDITY%20AND%20BLOCKED%20ACCOUNTS%2FPARTIES).  
\- In all cases, **each payment order is indivisible** during settlement – **no partial payment splitting is allowed**. T2’s rules explicitly require that if available funds are insufficient and **partial execution is not allowed, the order is rejected (or remains queued) rather than partially settled**[\[5\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/consolidation/profuse/shared/pdf/rtgs_urd_v3-0.en.pdf#:~:text=of%20liquidity%20and%20partial%20execution,transfer%20order%20shall%20be%20rejected). This applies to normal payments just as it does to liquidity transfers.

## Multilateral (Cycle-Based) Offsetting and Netting of Mismatched Amounts

Beyond bilateral pairings, T2 provides **multilateral offsetting** (often via timed or event-triggered _optimisation cycles_) to resolve gridlocks involving multiple banks. In these procedures, the system looks for a **group of queued payments among several participants that can all settle simultaneously** if their _gross_ obligations are offset by _incoming_ funds from others in the group[\[1\]](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1089.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Multilateral%20offsetting%3A%20Offsetting%20payments,outstanding%20payment%20value%20is%20larger). The classic example is a payment “cycle” (A owes B, B owes C, C owes A, etc.) or any configuration where participants collectively owe each other. T2’s **optimisation algorithm** will gather a set of pending transactions and test if each participant’s **net** position in that set can be covered by its available liquidity (within debit caps/limits)[\[7\]](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1089.pdf#:~:text=20Where%20netting%20is%20possible%2C%20and,cover%20its%20net%20outstanding%20obligation). If yes, the system will settle all those payments at once (each as a gross individual transfer, but **effectively netting out** within the group). If even one payment in the candidate set cannot be executed (e.g. a participant doesn’t have enough funds for its net debit), then **the entire group settlement fails and none of those payments are executed in that cycle**[\[8\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/consolidation/profuse/shared/pdf/rtgs_urd_v3-0.en.pdf#:~:text=simultaneously%20executed,others%20are%20not%20executed%20neither). This all-or-nothing approach ensures no partial outcomes – either the whole offsetting set settles together or it doesn’t, maintaining the integrity of each full payment instruction.

**Exact matching vs. partial netting:** T2’s multilateral LSM **does not require exact value matching** of payments; it supports offsetting among _unequal_ payment values by using available liquidity to cover any net imbalances. In other words, the algorithm seeks to **maximize settlement volume with minimal liquidity** by allowing **partial netting** of obligations, as long as each bank’s _net_ outgoing amount in the group is fully funded[\[7\]](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1089.pdf#:~:text=20Where%20netting%20is%20possible%2C%20and,cover%20its%20net%20outstanding%20obligation). This is sometimes called a _“partial optimisation”_ approach – not because any payment is partially paid, but because the algorithm can settle a _subset_ of queued payments (dropping some instructions that prevent balance within the group) instead of insisting on one big all-or-nothing set[\[4\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/target2/profuse/nov_2019/shared/pdf/T2_UDFS_book_1_v13.01_20191025.pdf#:~:text=indica%02tor%20is%20not%20fulfilled,earmarking%20of%20payments%20for%20removal). Older TARGET2 documentation described distinct algorithms – e.g. _“All-or-nothing”_ vs _“Partial”_ vs _“Multiple”_ optimisation – which essentially involved trying different combinations of queued payments to find a feasible set[\[9\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/target2/profuse/nov_2019/shared/pdf/T2_UDFS_book_1_v13.01_20191025.pdf#:~:text=The%20normal%20queue%20is%20continuously,are%20four%20different%20algorithms%20availa%02ble)[\[4\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/target2/profuse/nov_2019/shared/pdf/T2_UDFS_book_1_v13.01_20191025.pdf#:~:text=indica%02tor%20is%20not%20fulfilled,earmarking%20of%20payments%20for%20removal). In the new T2, this functionality is integrated into the real-time optimisation cycles: the system continuously or periodically searches for any solvable group of payments to settle. **No exact one-to-one matching is needed;** a cycle can clear mismatched payments (different sizes) provided any **net debit positions are covered by liquidity** or credit lines for those participants[\[7\]](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1089.pdf#:~:text=20Where%20netting%20is%20possible%2C%20and,cover%20its%20net%20outstanding%20obligation). Each payment in the cycle is then settled in full simultaneously, achieving the effect of multilateral netting without violating the RTGS principle of gross final settlement for individual transfers[\[8\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/consolidation/profuse/shared/pdf/rtgs_urd_v3-0.en.pdf#:~:text=simultaneously%20executed,others%20are%20not%20executed%20neither).

**Key points:**  
\- **Multilateral offset cycles** in T2 allow _gridlock resolution_ among multiple banks. The system’s optimisation mechanism will consider a group of queued payments and attempt to settle them together if doing so **reduces overall liquidity needs** and respects all bilateral/multilateral limits[\[1\]](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1089.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Multilateral%20offsetting%3A%20Offsetting%20payments,outstanding%20payment%20value%20is%20larger). This improves efficiency by leveraging the fact that a bank’s incoming payments can fund its outgoing payments within the group.  
\- **Exact matching is not required.** The algorithm can handle **unequal payment values** in a cycle – for example, a set of payments where each participant might still have a small net obligation. Those net amounts must be covered by the respective participants’ available funds, but the **bulk of each payment is offset by others** in the cycle[\[7\]](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1089.pdf#:~:text=20Where%20netting%20is%20possible%2C%20and,cover%20its%20net%20outstanding%20obligation). Thus, T2 supports **partial netting of mismatched sizes**: it achieves liquidity saving by settling the entire group of payments only when every participant’s _net_ debit is payable. Any payment that would cause an uncovered shortfall will simply prevent that set from settling (or be excluded in a different optimisation run) rather than being partially settled.  
\- When a multilateral optimisation is successful, **all selected payments settle simultaneously on a gross basis** (within the same logical second)[\[10\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/consolidation/profuse/shared/pdf/rtgs_urd_v3-0.en.pdf#:~:text=without%20prejudice%20to%20the%20use,020). If **one transfer fails** due to insufficient funds or limit breach, **then none of the grouped payments are executed** in that attempt[\[8\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/consolidation/profuse/shared/pdf/rtgs_urd_v3-0.en.pdf#:~:text=simultaneously%20executed,others%20are%20not%20executed%20neither). This ensures the integrity of each payment – no single instruction is left half-complete. T2 will then typically try a different combination or wait for new liquidity/events to re-run the optimisation.

## Conclusion

In summary, **T2’s LSM optimizations include both bilateral and multilateral (group) offsetting algorithms**, aimed at settling as many queued payments as possible with minimal liquidity. **Partial or split settlements of individual payment orders are _not_ allowed** – each payment is only settled in its entirety[\[5\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/consolidation/profuse/shared/pdf/rtgs_urd_v3-0.en.pdf#:~:text=of%20liquidity%20and%20partial%20execution,transfer%20order%20shall%20be%20rejected). However, the offsetting **does support partial netting** of **unequal payment values** across participants: T2’s cycles will settle groups of transactions without requiring their values to exactly match, so long as any net difference for each participant is covered by available liquidity[\[7\]](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1089.pdf#:~:text=20Where%20netting%20is%20possible%2C%20and,cover%20its%20net%20outstanding%20obligation). All matched payments in an optimisation cycle are **executed together (gross, final)**, achieving liquidity saving via coordinated timing rather than by breaking payments into pieces[\[8\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/consolidation/profuse/shared/pdf/rtgs_urd_v3-0.en.pdf#:~:text=simultaneously%20executed,others%20are%20not%20executed%20neither). This design, documented in Eurosystem specifications and user manuals, provides T2 participants with advanced queue management and gridlock resolution tools to economize on intraday liquidity while preserving the strict full-value settlement of each payment instruction[\[2\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/consolidation/profuse/shared/pdf/rtgs_urd_v3-0.en.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Payment%20orders%20on%20top,AVAILABLE%20LIQUIDITY%20AND%20BLOCKED%20ACCOUNTS%2FPARTIES)[\[4\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/target2/profuse/nov_2019/shared/pdf/T2_UDFS_book_1_v13.01_20191025.pdf#:~:text=indica%02tor%20is%20not%20fulfilled,earmarking%20of%20payments%20for%20removal).
