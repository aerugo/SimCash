# Paper Generation Configuration
# This file specifies exactly which experiment runs to use for paper generation.
# This prevents ambiguity when databases contain multiple runs.

# Database paths (relative to paper_generator/ directory)
databases:
  exp1: data/exp1.db
  exp2: data/exp2.db
  exp3: data/exp3.db

# Experiment passes - explicit run_ids for each pass
# Updated 2025-12-19 with fresh runs for reproducibility validation
