    This scenario tests a fundamental tradeoff in payment systems:
    - Allocating liquidity from the pool allows you to settle payments
    - But allocated liquidity has an opportunity cost

    The KEY DECISION in this scenario is: What fraction of the liquidity pool
    should be allocated at the START of the day?

    IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
    1. Focus your optimization ONLY on the `initial_liquidity_fraction` parameter (0.0 to 1.0)
    2. DO NOT modify payment_tree - keep it as a simple Release action
    3. DO NOT modify strategic_collateral_tree - it should remain as HoldCollateral
    4. The ONLY thing you should change is initial_liquidity_fraction

    With a hard liquidity constraint (no overdraft allowed), you must have
    sufficient balance to settle each payment. Incoming payments from the
    counterparty provide liquidity that can be recycled for your outgoing payments.
