# Payment Simulator: Grand Plan 2.0
## From Foundation to Full Vision

**Document Version**: 2.2
**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Status**: Foundation + Integration + Policy DSL Complete → Cost Model & Feature Expansion

---

## Executive Summary

### Project Purpose

Build a sandboxed, multi-agent simulator of high-value payment operations that demonstrates how banks strategically time and fund outgoing payments during the business day. The simulator models real-world RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement) systems like TARGET2, where banks must balance competing pressures: minimizing liquidity costs, meeting payment deadlines, avoiding gridlock, and maintaining system throughput.

**Core Innovation**: Each bank is controlled by a **decision-tree policy** (small, auditable program) that determines payment timing and liquidity management. An **asynchronous LLM Manager service** improves policies between simulation episodes through code editing, with all changes validated via automated testing and Monte Carlo shadow replay before deployment.

### What We've Achieved: Core + Integration + DSL Complete ✅

The Rust core backend is **complete and battle-tested**:

- ✅ **Phase 1-2**: Time management, RNG (xorshift64*), Agent state, Transaction models
- ✅ **Phase 3**: RTGS settlement engine + LSM (bilateral offsetting + cycle detection)
- ✅ **Phase 4a**: Queue 1 (internal bank queues) + Cash Manager policies (FIFO, Deadline, LiquidityAware)
- ✅ **Phase 4b**: Complete 9-step orchestrator tick loop integrating all components
- ✅ **Phase 5**: Transaction splitting (agent-initiated payment pacing)
- ✅ **Phase 6**: Arrival generation with configurable distributions (Poisson, normal, lognormal, uniform)
- ✅ **Phase 7**: Integration layer complete (PyO3 FFI, FastAPI, CLI tool)
- ✅ **Phase 9 (DSL)**: Complete policy DSL infrastructure (~4,880 lines) with expression evaluator, JSON decision trees, validation pipeline, and 50+ field accessors

**Test Coverage**: 107+ passing tests with zero failures (60+ Rust core + 24 FFI + 23 API integration), including critical invariants (determinism, balance conservation, gridlock resolution). Policy DSL has 940+ lines of tests.

### Where We're Going: Feature Expansion 🎯

**Completed Phases** ✅:
- **Phase 7** (Integration Layer): PyO3 FFI bindings, FastAPI endpoints, CLI tool - COMPLETE
- **Phase 9 DSL Infrastructure**: Expression evaluator, JSON decision trees, validation pipeline - COMPLETE

**In Progress** 🔄:
- **Phase 8** (Cost Model): ~60% complete
  - ✅ Core structures (CostRates, CostBreakdown, CostAccumulator)
  - ✅ Cost calculations (4/5 types: liquidity, delay, split friction, deadline)
  - ❌ Missing: Collateral cost, API exposure, metrics endpoints

**Next Steps** (10-14 weeks):
1. ✅ Complete Phase 8: Add cost/metrics API endpoints, collateral cost
2. ❌ Phase 9 (Learning): Shadow replay, policy evolution, LLM integration (deferred to Phase 13)
3. ❌ Phase 10: Multi-rail support (RTGS + DNS, cross-border corridors)
4. ❌ Phase 11: Shock scenarios (outages, liquidity squeezes, counterparty stress)
5. ❌ Phase 12: Production readiness (WebSocket streaming, frontend, observability)
6. ❌ Phase 13: LLM Manager Integration (asynchronous policy evolution)

## Part I: Background & Real-World Grounding

### 1.1 The Real-World Problem

**Who Are the Agents?**  
Real-world intraday cash managers (treasury operations teams) at banks who decide:
- **When** to release payments across settlement rails (Fedwire, CHAPS, TARGET2)
- **How** to fund them (overdraft, collateralized intraday credit, repo markets)
- **Which** payments to prioritize (client obligations, house flows, regulatory deadlines)

**What Actually Moves?**  
**Settlement balances** at the central bank. When a bank debits a customer's account internally, no interbank money moves yet. The scarce resource intraday is **settlement liquidity** — the bank's balance at the central bank plus any available intraday credit.

**How Do They Fund Payments?**
- Opening balances (overnight reserves)
- Incoming payments (liquidity recycling)
- Priced overdraft (10-50 bps annualized) or collateralized intraday credit
- Intraday repo/money market borrowing
- Pre-funded nostro accounts for cross-border corridors

### 1.2 Operational Realities

Real payment systems face multiple constraints:

**Time Constraints**:
- Cut-off windows (market closes, CLS/PvP deadlines, payroll times)
- Throughput expectations (settle X% by time T to avoid end-of-day bunching)
- Business day structure (morning peaks, lunchtime lulls, afternoon surges)

**Liquidity Constraints**:
- Credit limits at central bank
- Bilateral exposure caps between banks
- Collateral availability and haircuts
- Nostro prefunding requirements

**Operational Realities**:
- Gridlock risk (if everyone waits for inflows, nothing moves)
- Compliance holds (AML screening can delay time-critical payments)
- Message processing capacity limits
- System outages and degraded mode operations

### 1.3 Why Liquidity-Saving Mechanisms Matter

Modern RTGS systems incorporate **LSMs (Liquidity-Saving Mechanisms)** to reduce liquidity requirements:

**Bilateral Offsetting**: If Bank A owes Bank B $100M and Bank B owes Bank A $80M, settle the net ($20M A→B) instead of gross ($180M total).

**Cycle Detection**: Find circular payment chains (A→B→C→A) and settle with minimal liquidity. A 3-bank cycle with payments of $100M each can settle with zero net liquidity movement.

**Empirical Evidence**: TARGET2 studies show LSMs reduce average delay by 40-60% and peak liquidity usage by 30-50% under constrained conditions (Danmarks Nationalbank, ECB operational studies).

**The Coordination Problem**: With costly liquidity, each bank prefers to wait for inflows. If all wait, gridlock forms. LSMs alleviate but don't eliminate the coordination challenge — they still need a *feed* of submitted payments to work with.

## Part II: Game Mechanics & Simulator Design

### 2.1 Core Simulation Loop

The simulator operates in **discrete ticks** (60-100 per simulated business day), with each tick executing a 9-step process:

#### Tick Loop Structure

**1. Arrivals** → New payment orders arrive at banks, entering Queue 1 (internal bank queues)

**2. Policy Evaluation** → Cash manager policies decide what to submit to RTGS vs. hold, whether to split large payments, whether to add liquidity

**3. Liquidity Decisions** → Banks may draw intraday credit, post collateral, or adjust buffers

**4. Queue 1 Processing** → Release decisions executed (transactions move from Queue 1 to "pending submission")

**5. Transaction Splitting** → Large payments optionally divided into N separate payment instructions

**6. RTGS Submission** → Selected transactions submitted to central RTGS (Queue 2)

**7. RTGS Settlement** → Immediate settlement if balance + credit headroom sufficient, otherwise queue

**8. LSM Optimization** → Bilateral offsetting and cycle detection on Queue 2

**9. Cost Accrual & Metrics** → Update costs, track KPIs, generate events

### 2.2 Two-Queue Architecture

The simulator models real-world payment flows through **two distinct queues**:

#### Queue 1: Internal Bank Queues
- **Purpose**: Strategic decision point for cash managers
- **Location**: Inside each bank (agent state)
- **Control**: Bank's policy determines release timing
- **Costs Apply**: Delay costs accrue here (bank chose to hold)
- **Actions Available**: Submit now, hold, split into N parts, drop

#### Queue 2: RTGS Central Queue
- **Purpose**: Mechanical liquidity wait at central bank
- **Location**: Central RTGS system (simulation state)
- **Control**: Automatic retry every tick
- **Costs Apply**: No delay costs (liquidity-constrained, not policy choice)
- **Actions Available**: LSM optimization attempts settlement

**Design Rationale**: This separation captures the reality that banks choose when to submit, but cannot force settlement — that depends on liquidity availability.

### 2.3 Transaction Lifecycle

**States**:
1. **Pending** — Arrived but not settled
   - In Queue 1: Awaiting cash manager release decision
   - In Queue 2: Submitted to RTGS, awaiting liquidity or LSM offset
2. **Settled** — Fully settled with immediate finality (final state)
3. **Dropped** — Rejected or past deadline (terminal state)

**Splitting Mechanics**:
- Banks may **voluntarily split** large payments at Queue 1 decision point
- Creates N independent child transactions (each with unique ID)
- Children inherit parent's sender, receiver, deadline, priority
- Each child processes independently through RTGS
- **Not a system feature** — purely a policy decision (agent-initiated pacing)
- Incurs **split friction cost**: `f_s × (N-1)` to reflect operational overhead

### 2.4 Cost Model

The simulator tracks five cost types:

**1. Liquidity Costs** (intraday credit/overdraft)
- **When**: Charged per tick while balance < 0
- **Formula**: `c_L × max(0, -B_i) × (1/ticks_per_day)`
- **Interpretation**: Annualized overdraft rate (10-50 bps typical)

**2. Collateral Costs** (for collateralized credit)
- **When**: Charged per tick while collateral posted
- **Formula**: `c_C × collateral_value × (1/ticks_per_day)`
- **Interpretation**: Opportunity cost of tying up securities

**3. Delay Costs** (Queue 1 only)
- **When**: Per tick while transaction remains in Queue 1
- **Formula**: `p_k × (t - t_arrival)` for each transaction
- **Interpretation**: Client dissatisfaction, reputational risk, opportunity cost
- **Note**: Does NOT apply to Queue 2 (liquidity wait is beyond bank's control)

**4. Split Friction Costs**
- **When**: Charged immediately upon splitting decision
- **Formula**: `f_s × (N-1)` for N-way split
- **Interpretation**: Message processing, reconciliation, coordination overhead

**5. Deadline Penalties**
- **When**: Transaction exceeds deadline or unsettled at end-of-day
- **Formula**: Per-transaction penalty (large, to incentivize completion)
- **Interpretation**: SLA violations, regulatory scrutiny

### 2.5 Observation Space for Policies

Policies (and future LLM managers) observe:

**Agent-Local State**:
- Current settlement balance `B_i`
- Available credit headroom `H_i`
- Queue 1 contents (transactions, ages, priorities, deadlines)
- Posted collateral and remaining capacity
- Expected inflows (short-term forecast)

**System-Level Signals** (coarse, public):
- System-wide throughput percentage
- Queue 2 pressure (queue length, age distribution)
- Time remaining to cut-offs
- Liquidity price indicators

**Temporal Context**:
- Current tick and day
- Ticks to deadline for each transaction
- Time since last policy evaluation

**Note**: Banks do NOT see other banks' Queue 1 contents or exact balances (realistic information structure).

### 2.6 Design Principles Validated by Foundation

The foundation implementation validated several critical design choices:

**✅ Determinism is Achievable**:
- All randomness via seeded xorshift64* RNG
- Replay tests confirm identical outcomes for same seed
- Foundation for Monte Carlo shadow replay validation

**✅ Performance Targets Met**:
- Rust tick loop processes 1000+ ticks/second
- LSM cycle detection completes in <1ms for typical graphs
- Memory-efficient transaction queue management

**✅ Two-Queue Separation Works**:
- Clear distinction between policy decisions (Queue 1) and mechanical waits (Queue 2)
- Delay costs apply only to Queue 1 (as intended)
- Policies have natural decision hooks at arrival time

**✅ LSM Delivers Expected Benefits**:
- Four-bank ring test settles with minimal liquidity (Section 11 from Game Design Doc)
- Bilateral offsetting reduces settlement liquidity by 30-40% in balanced scenarios
- Cycle detection resolves simple gridlocks automatically

**Collateral Cost**:
- ❌ Agent model has no `posted_collateral` field
- ❌ No `calculate_collateral_cost()` function
- ❌ No collateral opportunity cost accrual

**Testing**:
- ❌ No tests for cost calculations
- ❌ No integration tests across FFI boundary for costs
- ❌ No end-to-end tests via API endpoints

- Rustdoc comments on all public APIs

**What You Can Do Now**:
- ✅ Define complex decision trees in JSON
- ✅ Hot-reload policies without restarting
- ✅ Use LLM to generate/edit policy JSON safely
- ✅ Validate policies before execution
- ✅ A/B test different policies
- ✅ Version control policies (just need git wrapper)

#### What's Deferred to Phase 13 (LLM Manager)

The following features were designed in Phase 9 but intentionally deferred:

**Shadow Replay System** (Designed, Not Implemented):
- Re-evaluate historical episodes with new policy
- Monte Carlo opponent sampling
- KPI comparison and validation
- **Reason**: Requires episode collection infrastructure (Phase 13)

**Policy Evolution Pipeline** (Designed, Not Implemented):
- Async policy validation service
- KPI comparison engine (old vs. new)
- Guardrail checking (cost delta thresholds)
- Automated deployment logic
- **Reason**: Requires LLM Manager service (Phase 13)

**Continuous Learning Loop** (Designed, Not Implemented):
- Episode collection (store seeds + results)
- LLM policy proposal generation
- Policy validation pipeline
- Automated deployment (git commit + restart)
- **Reason**: This IS the LLM Manager system (Phase 13)

**Architectural Decision**: Phase 9 focused on building safe, sandboxed DSL infrastructure that works independently. Phase 13 will add the LLM integration layer that USES this DSL. This separation allows:
1. Testing and validating DSL before adding LLM complexity
2. Using the DSL for manual policy development
3. Hot-reloading policies without LLM involvement

## Part IV: Roadmap to Full Vision

### 4.4 Phase 8 Completion: Cost Model API Layer (Week 4 - Remaining)

**Status**: 60% complete (Rust core done, Python API layer needed)

**Goal**: Expose cost data and metrics via REST API

**Remaining Tasks** (2-3 days):

1. **Rust FFI Additions** (backend/src/ffi/orchestrator.rs):
   ```rust
   // Add these methods to PyOrchestrator
   fn get_agent_costs(&self, agent_id: String) -> PyResult<HashMap<String, i64>>
   fn get_system_metrics(&self) -> PyResult<HashMap<String, f64>>
   ```

2. **Python API Endpoints** (api/payment_simulator/api/main.py):
   ```python
   @app.get("/simulations/{sim_id}/costs")
   async def get_costs(sim_id: str) -> CostBreakdownResponse

   @app.get("/simulations/{sim_id}/metrics")
   async def get_metrics(sim_id: str) -> MetricsResponse

   @app.get("/metrics")  # Prometheus format
   async def prometheus_metrics() -> Response
   ```

3. **Collateral Cost** (backend/src/models/agent.rs + orchestrator/engine.rs):
   - Add `posted_collateral: i64` field to AgentState
   - Implement `calculate_collateral_cost()` function
   - Integrate into `accrue_costs()` tick step

4. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for collateral cost formula
   - Integration tests for FFI cost queries
   - E2E tests via FastAPI endpoints

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All 5 cost types operational (including collateral)
- ✅ Can query per-agent costs via `/simulations/{id}/costs`
- ✅ Can query system-wide metrics via `/simulations/{id}/metrics`
- ✅ Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint operational

### 4.5 Phase 9 Completion: Learning Infrastructure (Weeks 5-7 - Deferred to Phase 13)

**Status**: DSL infrastructure 100% complete, learning loop deferred

**Note**: The Policy DSL (expression evaluator, JSON trees, validation) is **complete and operational**. The remaining Phase 9 work (shadow replay, policy evolution, LLM integration) has been intentionally deferred to **Phase 13: LLM Manager Integration**.

**Rationale**: The DSL can be used independently for manual policy development and hot-reloading. Adding LLM integration requires additional service infrastructure that's better implemented as Phase 13.

**What's Already Done** ✅:
- Expression evaluator (safe, sandboxed)
- JSON decision tree format
- Tree execution engine
- Validation pipeline
- 50+ field accessors
- Comprehensive testing (940+ lines)

**What's Deferred to Phase 13** (LLM Manager Service):
1. **Shadow Replay System**:
   - Re-evaluate past episodes with new policy
   - Monte Carlo opponent sampling
   - KPI delta estimation

2. **Policy Evolution Pipeline**:
   - Async LLM policy generation
   - Multi-stage validation (schema, properties, shadow replay)
   - Guardrail enforcement
   - Automated deployment

3. **Continuous Learning Loop**:
   - Episode collection infrastructure
   - Policy version management (git integration)
   - Feedback loop (performance tracking)

**Current Capability**: You can manually create/edit JSON policies and hot-reload them. LLM automation will be added in Phase 13.

### 4.6 Phase 10: Multi-Rail & Cross-Border (Weeks 8-9) ❌ **NOT STARTED**

**Status**: 0% complete - All work is future

**Goal**: Support multiple settlement rails and currency corridors

**Current Limitation**: System only supports:
- Single RTGS rail (no DNS, no ACH)
- Single currency (i64 cents, no multi-currency)
- Domestic payments only (no cross-border)
- One central RTGS queue (Queue 2)

#### Multi-Rail Architecture
**Deliverable**: RTGS + DNS (Deferred Net Settlement) rail

**Concepts**:
- **RTGS**: Real-time gross (individual), immediate finality
- **DNS**: Batch net (bilateral), periodic settlement windows

**Tasks**:
1. **Rail Abstraction**:
   - `SettlementRail` trait with `submit()`, `process()` methods
   - Rail-specific configs (RTGS: LSM enabled; DNS: batch times)
   - Rail selection in transaction submission

2. **DNS Implementation**:
   - Accumulate bilateral positions (A→B net)
   - Periodic settlement windows (e.g., every 50 ticks)
   - Batch processing with netting

   - Cost implications (DNS cheaper but delayed)
   - Strategic rail selection

**Testing**:
- RTGS + DNS coexistence tests
- Netting correctness (bilateral positions)
- Liquidity transfers between rails

#### Cross-Border Corridors
**Deliverable**: Multi-currency nostro accounts

**Tasks**:
1. **Currency Model**:
   - Multiple currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, SEK)
   - Per-currency nostro accounts
   - Exchange rate management (static or dynamic)

2. **Correspondent Banking**:
   - Nostro prefunding (agents fund foreign currency accounts)

3. **Counterparty Stress**:
   - Specific bank loses access to credit
   - Large idiosyncratic outflow (margin call)
   - Bilateral cap reduction (credit concern)

4. **Fee Regime Change**:
   - Switch overdraft pricing mid-day
   - Observe behavioral response (hoarding vs. release)

5. **Deadline Cascade**:
   - Concentrated deadline cluster (e.g., noon PvP window)
   - Measure priority escalation and LSM load

**Implementation**:
- `ShockSchedule` in config (tick, type, parameters)
- Runtime shock injection (via orchestrator)
- Shock-aware metrics (pre/during/post comparison)

**Testing**:
- Each shock type in isolation
- Combined shocks (liquidity squeeze + outage)
- Recovery validation (system returns to normal)

**Success Criteria**:
- Can inject shocks at specified ticks
- Metrics show expected responses
- System recovers after shock removal

**Estimated Effort**: 1 week

### 4.8 Phase 12: Production Readiness (Weeks 11-13) ❌ **NOT STARTED**

**Goal**: Observability, performance, and user experience

#### WebSocket Streaming
**Deliverable**: Real-time state updates to clients

**Tasks**:
1. **Event Bus**:
   - Publish tick events (arrivals, settlements, cost updates)
   - Subscribe pattern (clients filter event types)
   - Buffering for slow clients

2. **WebSocket Endpoint**:
   - `WS /websocket` — real-time event stream
   - JSON-encoded events with timestamps
   - Heartbeat/keepalive mechanism

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - React context for WebSocket connection
   - Live update of agent cards, transaction lists
   - Real-time charts (throughput, queues, costs)

**Testing**:

#### React Frontend
**Deliverable**: Web UI for simulation control and visualization

**Components**:
1. **Dashboard**:
   - Agent cards (balance, queue size, costs)
   - System-wide KPIs (throughput, peak debit)
   - Timeline chart (tick progress)

2. **Transaction List**:
   - Filterable/sortable table (by status, agent, amount)
   - Detail modal (full transaction attributes)
   - Submission form (manual transactions)

3. **Control Panel**:
   - Start/stop/reset buttons
   - Tick stepping (manual advance)
   - Speed control (auto-tick interval)

4. **Configuration Editor**:
   - YAML editor with validation
   - Save/load config files
   - Example configs (dropdown)

**Testing**:
- Component unit tests
- E2E tests (user flows)
- Responsive design validation

#### Observability & Logging
**Deliverable**: Production-grade logging and metrics

**Tasks**:
1. **Structured Logging**:
   - JSON logs with trace IDs
   - Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
   - Per-request context (simulation ID, tick)

2. **Metrics Export**:
   - Prometheus-compatible endpoint
   - Metrics: request rate, latency, tick duration, queue sizes
   - Grafana dashboard template

3. **Health Checks**:
   - Liveness probe (service responding)
   - Readiness probe (simulation ready)
   - Dependency checks (optional DB, cache)

4. **Performance Profiling**:
   - `cargo flamegraph` for Rust hot paths
   - Python profiler for API layer
   - Optimization based on profiling data

**Success Criteria**:
- Real-time updates work for 10+ concurrent clients
- Frontend displays all simulation state correctly
- Logs and metrics enable debugging
- Performance targets met (>1000 ticks/sec maintained)

**Estimated Effort**: 3 weeks

### 4.9 Phase 13: LLM Manager Integration (Weeks 14-16) ❌ **NOT STARTED**

**Goal**: Asynchronous policy evolution via LLM

#### LLM Manager Service
**Deliverable**: Separate service for policy improvement

**Architecture**:
- **Decoupled**: Runs independently of simulator
- **Asynchronous**: Simulator never blocks on LLM calls
- **Episode-Driven**: Improves policies between simulation runs

**Tasks**:
1. **Policy Proposal Generation**:
   - Input: Episode history (seeds, KPIs, opponent policies)
   - LLM prompt: "Improve policy to reduce cost while maintaining throughput"
   - Output: Candidate policy (YAML DSL)

2. **Automated Validation**:
   - Schema validation (syntax correctness)
   - Property tests (no negative amounts, valid actions)
   - Shadow replay (Monte Carlo with sampled opponents)
   - Guardrails (KPI deltas within acceptable range)

3. **Deployment Pipeline**:
   - Git commit for approved policy
   - Tag with version (e.g., `agent_A_policy_v23`)
   - Rollback mechanism (revert to previous commit)

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Collect episode results with new policy
   - Update LLM context with outcomes
   - Iterate improvement proposals

**Testing**:
- LLM manager isolation (mock responses)
- Validation pipeline (reject malformed policies)
- Shadow replay correctness
- Full loop (propose → validate → deploy → collect results)

#### Multi-Agent Learning
**Deliverable**: Simultaneous policy evolution

**Challenges**:
- Non-stationary environment (opponents evolve)
- Credit assignment (who caused outcome?)
- Exploration vs. exploitation

**Approach**:
1. **Self-Play**:
   - Multiple agents improve simultaneously
   - Each sees others as evolving opponents
   - Sample opponent behaviors from recent episodes

2. **Population-Based Training**:
   - Maintain policy population per agent
   - Select diverse opponents for shadow replay
   - Promote successful policies

3. **Convergence Detection**:
   - Monitor KPI stability over episodes
   - Flag oscillations or divergence
   - Human-in-loop review for anomalies

**Testing**:
- Multi-agent learning scenarios (2-bank, 4-bank)
- Convergence validation (stable equilibrium)
- Robustness tests (shocks during learning)

**Success Criteria**:
- LLM manager can propose valid policy changes
- Shadow replay validates without false positives
- Policies improve over episodes (lower costs or higher throughput)
- Learning converges to stable strategies

**Note on Phase 9 Deferred Work**: This phase incorporates the shadow replay system, policy evolution pipeline, and continuous learning loop that were originally designed as part of Phase 9 but intentionally deferred. The Phase 9 DSL infrastructure (expression evaluator, tree executor, validation) is already complete and provides the foundation for this LLM integration work.

**Estimated Effort**: 3 weeks

### 5.2 Data Flow for Single Tick

**Tick N Execution Sequence**:

```
1. Arrival Generation
   ├─ RNG.sample_poisson(rate) → arrival_count
   ├─ For each arrival:
   │  ├─ RNG.sample_distribution(type, params) → amount
   │  ├─ RNG.select_counterparty(weights) → dest_bank
   │  └─ Transaction.new(sender, dest, amount, deadline, priority)
   ├─ SimulationState.add_transactions(new_txs)
   └─ Agent.queue_outgoing(tx_ids) → Queue 1

2. Policy Evaluation
   ├─ For each agent with Queue 1 items:
   │  ├─ Policy.evaluate_queue(agent, state, tick) → Vec<ReleaseDecision>
   │  ├─ Process decisions:
   │  │  ├─ SubmitFull: Remove from Queue 1, add to pending submissions
   │  │  ├─ Hold(reason): Keep in Queue 1, log hold reason
   │  │  ├─ SubmitPartial(factor): Create split children, remove parent
   │  │  └─ Drop: Remove from Queue 1, apply deadline penalty
   │  └─ Update agent.last_decision_tick

3. Liquidity Decisions
   ├─ For each agent:
   │  ├─ Check liquidity_pressure()
   │  ├─ If needed: Agent.draw_credit(amount)
   │  └─ If excess: Agent.repay_credit(amount)

4. Transaction Splitting
   ├─ For each split decision:
   │  ├─ Validate eligibility (amount > threshold, factor <= max)
   │  ├─ Create N child transactions (inherit parent attributes)
   │  ├─ Apply split friction cost: cost += f_s × (N-1)
   │  └─ Add children to pending submissions

5. RTGS Submission
   ├─ For each pending transaction:
   │  ├─ RTGS.submit_transaction(tx, agent_balance, credit_limit)
   │  ├─ If balance + credit >= amount:
   │  │  ├─ Immediate settlement: debit sender, credit receiver
   │  │  └─ Update tx.status = Settled, tx.settlement_tick = N
   │  └─ Else:
   │     ├─ Add to Queue 2 (RTGS central queue)
   │     └─ Update tx.status = Pending (in Queue 2)

6. Queue 2 Processing (FIFO Retry)
   ├─ For each transaction in Queue 2:
   │  ├─ Check deadline: if tick > deadline → Drop, apply penalty
   │  ├─ Else: RTGS.try_settle(tx, agent_balance, credit_limit)
   │  ├─ If success: Settle, remove from Queue 2
   │  └─ Else: Remain in Queue 2 (retry next tick)

7. LSM Optimization
   ├─ LSM.run_lsm_pass(Queue 2, agents, config):
   │  ├─ Iteration 1: Bilateral offsetting
   │  │  ├─ For each pair (i, j):
   │  │  │  ├─ Find A→B and B→A transactions
   │  │  │  ├─ If amounts match: Settle both with zero liquidity
   │  │  │  └─ Else: Net settlement (reduce larger, settle smaller)
   │  │  └─ Remove settled transactions from Queue 2
   │  ├─ Iteration 2+: Cycle detection
   │  │  ├─ Build payment graph from Queue 2
   │  │  ├─ DFS to detect cycles (A→B→C→...→A)
   │  │  ├─ For each cycle: Calculate bottleneck amount
   │  │  ├─ Settle cycle with net-zero liquidity (or minimal partial)
   │  │  └─ Remove settled/reduced transactions from Queue 2
   │  └─ Repeat until no progress (typically 2-3 iterations)

8. Cost Accrual
   ├─ For each agent:
   │  ├─ Liquidity cost: c_L × max(0, -balance) × (1/ticks_per_day)
   │  ├─ Collateral cost: c_C × collateral × (1/ticks_per_day)
   │  └─ For each tx in Queue 1:
   │     └─ Delay cost: p_k × (tick - arrival_tick)
   ├─ Accumulate to agent.total_cost
   └─ Accumulate to state.system_total_cost

9. Metrics Update
   ├─ Calculate throughput: settled_value / arrived_value
   ├─ Update queue statistics (sizes, ages)
   ├─ Track peak net debits (max negative balance)
   ├─ LSM efficacy: (bilateral_count, cycle_count, liquidity_saved)
   └─ Emit tick event (for WebSocket subscribers)

10. Time Advancement
    └─ TimeManager.advance_tick() → tick = N+1
```

### 5.3 Memory Management & Safety

#### Rust Ownership Model
- **SimulationState**: Owns all agents, transactions, queues
- **Orchestrator**: Owns SimulationState, RNG, time manager
- **No shared mutable state**: All mutations go through Orchestrator methods
- **No reference cycles**: State graph is acyclic (transactions ref agent IDs, not pointers)

#### FFI Boundary Safety
1. **Rust→Python**:
   - Clone data to Python-owned dictionaries (no shared references)
   - Return by value (Python gets copy, Rust retains ownership)
   - Never return raw pointers or references

2. **Python→Rust**:
   - Validate all inputs before crossing boundary
   - Convert to Rust-owned types (no Python object retention)
   - Use `Result<T, E>` for all fallible operations

3. **Memory Leak Prevention**:
   - No `Rc<RefCell<>>` across FFI (ownership must be clear)
   - PyO3 handles Python reference counting
   - Rust drops state when simulation deleted (RAII)

#### Testing Strategy
- **Valgrind**: Run FFI tests under memcheck (detect leaks)
- **ASAN/MSAN**: Sanitizers in CI (catch use-after-free, uninitialized memory)
- **Stress tests**: 10,000 tick simulations (verify no accumulation)

### 5.4 Determinism Guarantees

**Requirement**: Identical seed → identical outcomes (every time, every platform)

**Implementation**:
1. **Single RNG Source**: All randomness via `RngManager.xorshift64*`
2. **Explicit Seeding**: Every stochastic operation seeds from RNG
3. **No System Time**: Forbidden (use tick counter for time)
4. **No Floats in Core Logic**: Avoid IEEE rounding inconsistencies (money as `i64`)
5. **Stable Iteration Order**: Use `Vec` (not `HashMap`) for deterministic ordering

**Testing**:
- Replay tests: Run same seed 100 times, assert all outputs identical
- Cross-platform tests: Run on Linux/macOS/Windows, compare outputs
- Long-run tests: 10,000 tick simulation, verify final state matches

**Debugging Aid**:
- Event log: Record every RNG call with (tick, operation, seed, result)
- Replay tool: Load event log, reproduce exact sequence

## Part VI: Development Guidelines

### 6.1 Core Principles

**1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- Write test first (defines specification)
- Implement feature to pass test
- Refactor with confidence (tests catch regressions)
- Maintain >80% coverage

**2. Type Safety**
- Rust: Leverage compiler (invalid states unrepresentable)
- Python: Type hints everywhere (`mypy` strict mode)
- FFI: Validate at boundary (don't trust inputs)

**3. Minimal Abstractions**
- Don't abstract prematurely
- Extract patterns after 3rd use (Rule of Three)
- Prefer explicit over clever

**4. Performance Awareness**
- Profile before optimizing
- Rust for hot paths (tick loop, LSM)
- Python for convenience (config, HTTP, testing)

**5. Documentation as Code**
- Rustdoc for public APIs
- Docstrings for Python (with examples)
- Inline comments for non-obvious logic
- Update docs with code (not after)

### 6.2 Code Review Checklist

**Before Committing**:
- [ ] All tests pass (`cargo test && pytest`)
- [ ] No compiler warnings (`cargo clippy`)
- [ ] Code formatted (`cargo fmt && black .`)
- [ ] Type checks pass (`mypy .`)

## Part VIII: Future Directions & Research

### 8.1 Advanced Learning Techniques

**1. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**
- Replace decision trees with neural network policies
- Train with PPO/SAC on continuous action spaces
- Self-play with population-based training
- Emergent coordination strategies

**2. Causal Inference**
- Identify causal relationships (e.g., "early submission → lower systemic delay")
- Estimate treatment effects (e.g., "LSM enablement → 30% liquidity reduction")
- Support counterfactual queries ("What if agent A changed policy?")

**3. Meta-Learning**
- Learn to learn (adapt policies quickly to new regimes)
- Few-shot adaptation to shocks
- Transfer learning across currencies/jurisdictions

### 8.2 Extensions & Variants

**1. Regulatory Scenarios**
- Basel III NSFR/LCR constraints
- CPMI-IOSCO PFMI compliance monitoring
- Throughput guidelines enforcement

**2. Market Microstructure**
- Intraday repo markets (borrow/lend liquidity)
- Collateral haircuts and margin calls
- Nostro funding optimization

**3. Crisis Simulations**
- Bank runs (sudden outflow shocks)
- Interbank contagion (bilateral exposure chains)
- Central bank interventions (emergency liquidity, rate changes)

**4. Privacy-Preserving Simulation**
- Federated learning (banks train locally, share updates)
- Differential privacy (add noise to published throughput signals)
- Secure multi-party computation (joint settlement without revealing balances)

### 8.3 Open Research Questions

1. **What throughput targets are Pareto-optimal?**
   - Too strict → costly hoarding
   - Too loose → gridlock risk
   - Can we characterize optimal thresholds?

2. **How do policies co-evolve in multi-agent learning?**
   - Do we converge to Nash equilibria?
   - Are there oscillations or limit cycles?
   - Can we design coordination mechanisms to stabilize?

3. **What are the welfare implications of LSM design?**
   - Who benefits from bilateral offsetting vs. cycles?
   - Are there distributional effects (large banks vs. small)?
   - How to design fair LSM algorithms?

4. **How resilient are learned policies to regime shifts?**
   - If overdraft pricing changes, do policies adapt?
   - Can we measure robustness to shocks?
   - What safety margins should policies maintain?

Phase 7 (Integration) ──┬──> Phase 8 (Costs) ──> Phase 9 (Policies)
                        │                              │
                        │                              v
                        └──> Phase 10 (Multi-Rail) ──> Phase 11 (Shocks)
                                                         │

## Conclusion

This Grand Plan 2.2 provides a comprehensive roadmap from the completed foundation, integration, and DSL infrastructure (Phases 1-7, 9 DSL) to the full vision of an LLM-driven, multi-agent payment simulator. The plan is structured in three major sections:

**Where We Are** (Part III):
- ✅ **Foundation Complete** (Phases 1-7): All Rust core components implemented, tested, and validated. Python integration layer fully operational with PyO3 FFI bindings, FastAPI endpoints, and production-ready CLI tool. 107+ tests pass with zero failures.
- ✅ **Policy DSL Complete** (Phase 9): ~4,880 lines of production code providing expression evaluator, JSON decision trees, validation pipeline, and 50+ field accessors. 940+ lines of tests validate correctness. Policies can be hot-reloaded and LLM-generated safely.
- 🔄 **Cost Model Partial** (Phase 8): Core structures and 4/5 cost calculations complete in Rust. Missing: API exposure, collateral cost, metrics endpoints. ~60% complete, 2-3 days remaining.

**Where We're Going** (Part IV):
- Complete Phase 8 (cost/metrics API layer)
- Build multi-rail support (RTGS + DNS, cross-border)
- Add shock scenarios and resilience testing
- Achieve production readiness (WebSocket, frontend, observability)
- Integrate LLM Manager for autonomous policy evolution (includes Phase 9 deferred work: shadow replay, learning loop)

**How We'll Get There** (Parts V-XII): Detailed technical architecture, development guidelines, deployment strategies, risk mitigation, success metrics, and getting-started instructions ensure the plan is actionable and maintainable.

**Critical Success Factors**:
1. **Maintain determinism** — Every new feature must preserve replay capability ✅ Validated
2. **Preserve two-queue separation** — Clear distinction between strategic (Queue 1) and mechanical (Queue 2) decisions ✅ Validated
3. **Test ruthlessly** — >80% coverage, property tests for invariants, integration tests across FFI ✅ Achieved (107+ core tests, 940+ DSL tests)
4. **Scope discipline** — Follow phased plan, defer non-critical features to backlog ✅ On track (Phase 9 learning deferred to Phase 13)
5. **Document as we go** — Keep docs synchronized with code, examples for all public APIs ✅ Maintained (2,700+ line DSL design doc)

**Major Achievements Since v2.1**:
- ✅ Policy DSL infrastructure complete (~4,880 lines)
- ✅ Expression evaluator with safe sandboxed execution
- ✅ JSON decision tree format with comprehensive validation
- ✅ 50+ field accessors for policy evaluation context
- ✅ Hot-reloadable policies (no simulator restart needed)
- ✅ Foundation for LLM-generated policies established

**Architectural Decisions Validated**:
- ✅ Rust-Python hybrid approach works (FFI overhead <1%)
- ✅ Two-queue separation enables clear policy abstractions
- ✅ Determinism maintained across all layers
- ✅ DSL can be used independently before LLM integration
- ✅ Large-scale performance validated (200 agents, 1,200 ticks/sec)

**Current Capability**:
- Run complex multi-agent simulations with configurable policies
- Define custom decision trees in JSON with safe expression evaluation
- Hot-reload policies without restarting
- Track costs (liquidity, delay, split friction, deadline penalties)
- Access via HTTP API, CLI, or direct Rust/Python integration
- Reproduce any simulation deterministically from seed

**Next Immediate Actions**:
1. **Complete Phase 8** (2-3 days): Add cost/metrics API endpoints, implement collateral cost
2. **Plan Phase 10 or 13**: Decide priority between multi-rail features vs. LLM integration
