# Using TARGET2 as a Model for Realistic RTGS Simulation

**TARGET2** (T2) - the Eurosystem's real-time gross settlement system - provides the blueprint for modeling real-world payment behavior in the SimCash RTGS simulator. TARGET2 settles high-value payments in central bank money with **immediate finality** while offering advanced liquidity management features to reduce banks' intraday liquidity needs[\[1\]](https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/sistema-pagamenti/target2/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1#:~:text=Payment%20orders%20are%20submitted%20to,limit%20on%20the%20transferable%20amount)[\[2\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2020/html/ecb.ebart202005_03~4a20eae0c8.en.html#:~:text=Liquidity%20plays%20a%20central%20role,incoming%20payments%2C%20thus%20making%20more). By aligning SimCash's design with TARGET2's mechanisms, we ensure that the simulation captures the key behaviors and constraints observed in actual RTGS operations. Below, we outline how SimCash emulates TARGET2 and enforces realistic bank strategies.

## Immediate Gross Settlement & Intraday Credit Access

**Real-time settlement with finality:** In TARGET2, payments are processed one by one in real time, and once a transaction settles it is final and irrevocable[\[1\]](https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/sistema-pagamenti/target2/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1#:~:text=Payment%20orders%20are%20submitted%20to,limit%20on%20the%20transferable%20amount). There is no upper limit on transaction value, and each payment is settled **gross** (individually) on central bank accounts. SimCash mirrors this: when a bank's payment is released to the RTGS, the simulator attempts to settle it instantly by debiting the sender's central bank balance and crediting the receiver's. This models the **immediate finality** principle of TARGET2, wherein each payment is settled outright upon processing[\[1\]](https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/sistema-pagamenti/target2/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1#:~:text=Payment%20orders%20are%20submitted%20to,limit%20on%20the%20transferable%20amount).

**Unlimited intraday credit against collateral:** To facilitate smooth settlement, TARGET2 offers participants **interest-free intraday credit** (intraday overdrafts) as long as they pledge sufficient eligible collateral to their central bank[\[3\]](https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/sistema-pagamenti/target2/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20settle%20payments,end%20of%20the%20business%20day). Banks can thus draw liquidity during the day but must fully repay by end-of-day (or else borrow overnight at a penalty rate)[\[3\]](https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/sistema-pagamenti/target2/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20settle%20payments,end%20of%20the%20business%20day)[\[4\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2020/html/ecb.ebart202005_03~4a20eae0c8.en.html#:~:text=intraday%20credit%20and%20the%20time,once%20it%20resumes%20settlement%20activity). In SimCash, each bank has an intraday credit line (or overdraft facility) determined by posted collateral. Banks can choose to post collateral (increasing credit headroom) or withdraw it, and they incur a cost for any credit used or collateral tied up. This ensures the simulation reflects the **collateralized credit** regime of real RTGS systems like TARGET2, where liquidity is ample but **not free** - banks face opportunity costs or penalty rates if they rely too heavily on central bank credit[\[4\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2020/html/ecb.ebart202005_03~4a20eae0c8.en.html#:~:text=intraday%20credit%20and%20the%20time,once%20it%20resumes%20settlement%20activity). Crucially, SimCash imposes **end-of-day penalties** for any unpaid credit or unsettled obligations, echoing TARGET2's rule that intraday credit must be repaid by day's end.

## Liquidity-Saving Mechanisms and Queues

**High liquidity needs and offsetting algorithms:** RTGS systems require substantial liquidity since payments settle individually, so they incorporate features to help participants **save liquidity**[\[2\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2020/html/ecb.ebart202005_03~4a20eae0c8.en.html#:~:text=Liquidity%20plays%20a%20central%20role,incoming%20payments%2C%20thus%20making%20more). TARGET2, for example, includes _offsetting algorithms_ (also called **liquidity-saving mechanisms**, LSMs) that can match payments and settle them simultaneously to reduce net liquidity requirements[\[5\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2020/html/ecb.ebart202005_03~4a20eae0c8.en.html#:~:text=6,end%20of%20the%20day%2C%20if). SimCash directly models this through its **two-queue architecture and LSM module**. When a payment is released but the sending bank lacks sufficient funds (even with credit), the transaction enters a central **Queue 2** instead of failing. The RTGS engine then continuously searches for offsetting opportunities among queued payments - mirroring TARGET2's optimization procedures[\[6\]](https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/sistema-pagamenti/target2/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1#:~:text=T2%20enables%20efficient%20liquidity%20management,CLM%29%20service%20that):

- **Bilateral offsetting:** If Bank A has a payment queued to Bank B and vice versa, SimCash will settle both **simultaneously** if each bank can cover the net difference between the two payments. This reflects how many RTGS (including TARGET2, RITS, BOJ-NET, etc.) run bilateral matching algorithms continuously[\[7\]](https://www.dnb.nl/media/m5xdz2nx/working-paper-no-682_tcm47.pdf#:~:text=that%20use%20multilateral%2019Bilateral%20offsetting,j%20to%20find%20an%20applicable). It ensures that two opposing payments don't unnecessarily await full liquidity if their **net** obligation is smaller[\[8\]](https://www.dnb.nl/media/m5xdz2nx/working-paper-no-682_tcm47.pdf#:~:text=3,Pi)[\[9\]](https://www.dnb.nl/media/m5xdz2nx/working-paper-no-682_tcm47.pdf#:~:text=19Bilateral%20offsetting%20is%20widely%20used,j%20to%20find%20an%20applicable).
- **Multilateral offsetting (cycle resolution):** SimCash's RTGS engine also detects cycles involving multiple banks (e.g. A→B, B→C, C→A) and settles the entire set **at once** if each participant can fund its net output position[\[10\]](https://www.dnb.nl/media/m5xdz2nx/working-paper-no-682_tcm47.pdf#:~:text=3,positions%20cannot%20be%20settled%20because). This models TARGET2's _optimisation procedures_ (as well as algorithms used in other systems) which identify groups of payments that can offset. All payments in the cycle settle simultaneously only if **every** bank has enough liquidity for its net debit - an all-or-nothing condition just like in TARGET2[\[11\]](https://www.dnb.nl/media/m5xdz2nx/working-paper-no-682_tcm47.pdf#:~:text=the%20Bech,21%20The%20process). If any bank in the cycle is too short, the cycle doesn't execute, preserving the atomicity that real RTGS systems require.

These LSM features in SimCash are **parametrized** so we can simulate different regimes. Running the simulation **with LSM enabled** replicates TARGET2's continuous offsetting approach (which runs such algorithms frequently throughout the day)[\[12\]](https://www.dnb.nl/media/m5xdz2nx/working-paper-no-682_tcm47.pdf#:~:text=that%20use%20multilateral%2019Bilateral%20offsetting,offsetting%20algorithm%20can%20search%20queued). This should yield outcomes observed in practice: lower peak liquidity usage and fewer gridlocks, as offsetting settles many queued payments using less cash[\[2\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2020/html/ecb.ebart202005_03~4a20eae0c8.en.html#:~:text=Liquidity%20plays%20a%20central%20role,incoming%20payments%2C%20thus%20making%20more). By contrast, disabling LSM in the simulator can mimic a basic RTGS (or a temporary outage of optimization), resulting in more queued transactions and potential gridlock - useful for understanding the value of TARGET2-like features[\[13\]](https://www.nationalbanken.dk/media/r2xgriaj/2001-mon4-grid67.pdf#:~:text=Nationalbank%20www,the%20last%20few%20decades).

**Two-tier queue design (internal vs central):** A unique aspect of SimCash is the separation of a bank's **internal queue (Queue 1)** from the **central queue (Queue 2)**. This mirrors real-world behavior in which banks often **schedule or delay some outgoing payments internally** for liquidity management, even though the RTGS itself does not mandate any delay. In TARGET2, apart from certain time-critical payments (e.g. hourly securities settlement batch or CLS pay-ins), banks are **free to manage the timing of their payment submissions** during the day[\[14\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2020/html/ecb.ebart202005_03~4a20eae0c8.en.html#:~:text=26,CET%20and%2018%3A00%20CET%2C%20and). Many participants strategically queue low-priority payments in their own systems and release them when conditions are favorable (sufficient liquidity or incoming funds arrived). SimCash captures this by letting each bank's **cash manager AI** decide at each tick which payments to send to the RTGS and which to hold back in Queue 1. This decision can depend on the bank's liquidity situation, the payment's urgency, and expected incoming funds - the same considerations real banks weigh in intraday liquidity management[\[15\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=The%20ensemble%20of%20payment%20funding,and%20economise%20on%20liquidity%20costs)[\[16\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=market%20activity%2C%20these%20developments%20are,liquidity%20risk%20for%20TARGET2%20participants).

**No partial payments unless split by banks:** TARGET2 settles each payment either in full or not at all - it does **not** partial-out a single instruction. However, banks can choose to split a large payment into multiple smaller payments if they wish to **pace** the outflow. In practice, banks occasionally do this manually for very large interbank payments, breaking them into chunks to facilitate faster partial settlement and liquidity recycling. SimCash explicitly allows this behavior: an agent's policy can decide to **split** a large transaction into N smaller independent payments (children) in its internal queue. All those children then proceed through settlement individually. The simulator charges a small cost for splitting, reflecting operational frictions, so an AI agent will only split when it expects a net benefit (e.g. to get part of a huge payment settled earlier rather than have the whole amount wait). This feature aligns with real-world practice where _partial_ settlement isn't automatic, but banks can achieve a similar effect by **dividing payments** on their end. It reinforces the principle that TARGET2's liquidity-saving occurs via smart scheduling and offsetting of **whole payments**[\[5\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2020/html/ecb.ebart202005_03~4a20eae0c8.en.html#:~:text=6,end%20of%20the%20day%2C%20if) - any breakdown into smaller pieces must be initiated by the sender, not by the RTGS system itself.

## Payment Priorities, Timed Transactions, and Reservations

**Priority classes:** TARGET2 allows participants to assign priority levels to payments (e.g. _Normal_, _Urgent_, _Highly Urgent_). Certain critical transactions (like central bank operations or ancillary system settlements) carry the highest priority and are settled with precedence[\[17\]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/268044/1/1814170057.pdf#:~:text=EconStor%20www,and%20TIPS%20and%20interbank%20payments). SimCash can emulate this by enabling a **priority flag** on transactions. In simulation scenarios that require it, payments marked as urgent can be processed before others in the RTGS queue (Queue 2), and banks' policies can treat priority transactions with special urgency in their internal decision-making. By default, all payments in SimCash are of equal priority (comparable to TARGET2's normal payments), but the infrastructure is in place to differentiate and **simulate the effect of urgency tiers**, ensuring that, for example, a critical payment isn't stuck behind a slew of low-value transfers. This helps model real-world behavior where banks will **always send critical payments immediately** and even allocate dedicated liquidity for them[\[17\]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/268044/1/1814170057.pdf#:~:text=EconStor%20www,and%20TIPS%20and%20interbank%20payments).

**Timed transactions:** Another TARGET2 feature is the ability to _schedule_ payments for future execution at a specific time (or after a certain event). For instance, a bank might input a payment with an earliest execution time (e.g. "not to be settled before 16:00 CET") or a latest time by which it must be settled. In SimCash, we model this by allowing **timed transactions** as an option: an agent can hold a payment in Queue 1 until a set tick or use a policy action that effectively says "release at a given future tick." This ensures that our simulation can represent scenarios like synchronized payments at market close or payments that are only relevant after a cutoff. When timed transactions are enabled, the RTGS can also respect these timestamps in ordering settlement. By including this, we capture yet another real-world mechanism banks use for coordinating payment timing in systems like TARGET2[\[18\]](https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/sistema-pagamenti/target2/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1#:~:text=T2%20enables%20efficient%20liquidity%20management,CLM%29%20service%20that).

**Liquidity reservations and limits:** TARGET2 (especially after its 2023 T2 upgrade) gives banks tools to reserve liquidity for certain purposes or set bilateral limits. For example, a participant can reserve a portion of liquidity exclusively for an ancillary system settlement or set a cap on how much it will pay to a particular counterparty until it receives funds. While our base SimCash model doesn't micromanage reservation by default, it's capable of simulating these constraints. We can configure "liquidity buffers" or sub-accounts per agent to mimic, say, a reserved amount that should not be used for normal payments (ensuring funds are held back for critical ones). The policy DSL even allows an agent to set a **release budget per tick** - effectively a self-imposed limit on how much value to send out in one go. This is analogous to banks throttling their outflows to avoid overextending liquidity. By adjusting these parameters, SimCash can study scenarios where, for instance, banks reserve liquidity for critical payments at specific times (much like real participants reserving funds for CLS pay-ins or TARGET2-Securities (T2S) settlements). These features align with TARGET2's offerings of liquidity reservation facilities and bilateral/multilateral limits[\[6\]](https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/sistema-pagamenti/target2/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1#:~:text=T2%20enables%20efficient%20liquidity%20management,CLM%29%20service%20that), thus enhancing the realism of bank behavior in the simulation.

## Simulating Bank Behavior and Intraday Dynamics

**Liquidity recycling vs. credit usage:** Empirical data from TARGET2 shows that banks rely first on their **own balances** and incoming payments to fund outgoing transfers, resorting to intraday credit only minimally. On average, about 73% of payments in TARGET2 are funded by existing balance, ~18.8% by **incoming payments** (liquidity recycled within minutes), and only ~8% by drawing on the intraday credit line[\[19\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=In%20TARGET2%2C%20the%20main%20source,for%20TARGET2%20participants%20is%20low). This indicates that banks prefer to **wait for inflows** or use cash on hand rather than incur overdrafts, reflecting a cautious approach to intraday liquidity risk[\[20\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=average%2C%2018.8,for%20TARGET2%20participants%20is%20low). SimCash is designed so that rational agents will demonstrate the same behavior under cost-sensitive policies. We assign a cost (or negative reward) to using credit and a cost to delaying payments; agents must strike a balance. In practice, a well-tuned agent learns that if a pending outgoing payment isn't urgent, it may be optimal to **delay it briefly in Queue 1** and see if an incoming payment arrives to cover it (thus avoiding an overdraft fee). This recreates the phenomenon of **liquidity recycling** observed in TARGET2, where a significant chunk of payments are effectively funded by synchronizing outgoing flows with incoming funds[\[21\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=Incoming%20payments%20are%20considered%20to,are%20funded%20using%20the%20ICL)[\[22\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=In%20TARGET2%2C%20the%20main%20source,for%20TARGET2%20participants%20is%20low). We even incorporate a concept of _incoming payment forecasts_ or public throughput indicators, so agents have clues about whether waiting might pay off. The result is that SimCash agents can emulate the real-world strategy of **active intraday liquidity management** - holding back when liquidity is tight and releasing when they have funds (either from their own balance or recent receipts)[\[23\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2020/html/ecb.ebart202005_03~4a20eae0c8.en.html#:~:text=addition%2C%20participants%20can%20use%20the,saving%20mechanisms%20are%20used%20less.%5B8).

**Payment urgency and service levels:** Not all payments are equal - some are time-critical (e.g. interbank loan repayments by cutoff, large client transactions, market settlement payments), while others are routine and can be deferred until later in the day. In actual RTGS operations, banks classify payments by urgency and often aim to process a large share of payments early to reduce operational risk[\[24\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2020/html/ecb.ebart202005_03~4a20eae0c8.en.html#:~:text=smoother,once%20it%20resumes%20settlement%20activity). TARGET2 itself does not enforce strict throughput quotas on participants, but other systems like CHAPS do have **throughput guidelines** (e.g. requiring 50% of daily payments be completed by mid-day) to prevent last-minute bulges[\[25\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=significantly.,value%20within%20fixed%20time%20slots). In SimCash, we can introduce **deadlines and throughput targets** to simulate these norms. Each transaction in the simulation carries a deadline (latest settlement time), and if it passes the deadline it will incur a penalty or drop - representing potential SLA breaches or regulatory penalties. Agents thus must prioritize based on deadlines and avoid procrastinating too much. We also have the flexibility to script scenarios with throughput rules (for instance, imposing a cost if an agent hasn't settled X% of value by a certain tick) to see how that pressures their behavior. This way, the simulator can capture the **time-sensitive nature** of some payments and the reality that banks cannot simply hold everything until the end. By calibrating delay penalty costs and deadlines, we ensure that "urgent" payments in the sim truly get treated urgently by the agents, much like a real bank would treat, say, a CHAPS high-priority payment or a TARGET2 **Highly Urgent** payment (which in reality would be settled immediately even if it means using expensive liquidity)[\[17\]](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/268044/1/1814170057.pdf#:~:text=EconStor%20www,and%20TIPS%20and%20interbank%20payments).

**Gridlock and strategic behavior:** A classic risk in RTGS is **gridlock** - a situation where many banks delay payments hoping to receive funds first, resulting in a standstill. TARGET2's design, with LSMs and ample credit, is specifically meant to mitigate gridlock by enabling settlement of circular dependencies and by making liquidity available at low cost. However, if credit is costly or limited, banks face a game-theoretic situation akin to a _stag hunt_ or prisoner's dilemma: everyone is better off if they all send payments early (settling smoothly), but an individual bank might be tempted to hold its payments if others are sending, to conserve liquidity. SimCash is built to explore this strategic space. By toggling parameters, we can simulate a **gridlock-prone regime** (e.g. collateral is scarce or expensive, so banks are reluctant to use credit) and observe how agents behave. We expect to see coordination failures if no mechanism exists to encourage early submission - which is consistent with theoretical models of intraday liquidity games[\[26\]](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr438.pdf#:~:text=these%20incentives%20change%20with%20the,on%20collateral%20while%20also%20providing)[\[27\]](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr438.pdf#:~:text=We%20show%20that%20an%20LSM,on%20collateral%20while%20also%20providing). We then can activate LSM and/or public status signals to see how those help break the deadlock (the LSM, by settling cycles, effectively rewards banks for submitting payments that might complete a cycle). This aligns with research findings that adding an LSM in a collateral-constrained RTGS **improves welfare and encourages earlier submissions** by allowing payments to settle via offsets[\[26\]](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr438.pdf#:~:text=these%20incentives%20change%20with%20the,on%20collateral%20while%20also%20providing)[\[28\]](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr438.pdf#:~:text=incentives%20to%20submit%20payments%20earlier,in%20our%20model%20welfare%20is). In short, SimCash can reproduce both **gridlock scenarios** and **smooth-flow scenarios**, depending on whether conditions resemble a tough liquidity environment or a well-resourced one. This lets us validate that our simulation's outcomes (e.g. delays, liquidity usage) qualitatively match those observed in real RTGS studies under analogous conditions[\[13\]](https://www.nationalbanken.dk/media/r2xgriaj/2001-mon4-grid67.pdf#:~:text=Nationalbank%20www,the%20last%20few%20decades).

## Reflecting Real Conditions and TARGET2-Specific Features

**Abundant vs. scarce liquidity scenarios:** One major real-world factor is the overall level of liquidity in the system. In recent years, TARGET2 participants have held excess reserves far above what's needed for payments (due to monetary policy), which has led to very low usage of intraday credit and less urgency in liquidity-saving measures[\[29\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=Interestingly%2C%20before%20November%202016%2C%20the,13)[\[30\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=In%20TARGET2%2C%20the%20main%20source,for%20TARGET2%20participants%20is%20low). SimCash can be configured to reflect an **abundant-liquidity environment** by giving agents large opening balances and low credit costs. In such a scenario, we'd expect to see behavior just like in TARGET2 post-2015: most payments settle immediately out of balances, very few wait in queues, and banks barely touch their credit lines[\[31\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=by%20comparison%2C%20in%202020%20the,the%20liquidity%20sources%20available%20to)[\[32\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=particular%2C%20with%20the%20upsurge%20in,First%2C%20they%20indicate%20a). On the other hand, by limiting initial balances and making credit expensive, we simulate a **scarce-liquidity environment** akin to earlier periods or stress scenarios. Here, banks in SimCash become much more cautious: they will heavily utilize incoming funds (recycle liquidity), delay non-urgent payments, and the LSM will actively fire to resolve pending queues. This matches historical patterns - when liquidity was tighter (or during crises), TARGET2 participants put more effort into timing payments and relied more on offsetting mechanisms[\[23\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2020/html/ecb.ebart202005_03~4a20eae0c8.en.html#:~:text=addition%2C%20participants%20can%20use%20the,saving%20mechanisms%20are%20used%20less.%5B8)[\[16\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=market%20activity%2C%20these%20developments%20are,liquidity%20risk%20for%20TARGET2%20participants). Our simulation framework thus allows us to study both extremes, ensuring that the modeled behavior tracks with what payment system operators expect: if liquidity were tightened in reality, we'd see exactly these increases in strategic delay and offset usage.

**Central Liquidity Management (CLM) and multi-currency potential:** The recent upgrade from TARGET2 to the new T2 system integrated a **Central Liquidity Management** module, meaning banks manage one pool of liquidity for multiple services (RTGS, securities settlement, instant payments)[\[33\]](https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/sistema-pagamenti/target2/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1#:~:text=facilities%2C%20bilateral%20and%20multilateral%20exposure,single%20main%20account%20linked%20to). While SimCash currently focuses on the RTGS module, we have structured it such that all liquidity lives in a central account per bank (conceptually similar to the main account in T2's CLM) with the possibility to simulate separate dedicated sub-accounts if needed. We haven't modeled multi-currency or securities settlement directly, but the architecture could be extended, given that the real T2 is now designed to potentially settle other currencies and interface with systems like T2S using the shared liquidity pool[\[6\]](https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/sistema-pagamenti/target2/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1#:~:text=T2%20enables%20efficient%20liquidity%20management,CLM%29%20service%20that). This forward-looking design means our simulator can incorporate future real-world developments (for example, if a bank had to allocate liquidity between euro and another currency RTGS, or between RTGS and an instant payment service, we could introduce constraints to mimic that). By basing our simulation on the unified liquidity concept of TARGET2/T2, we ensure that any **liquidity fragmentation issues** or solutions present in reality are representable in SimCash.

**Throughput monitoring and operational realism:** In practice, central banks monitor RTGS flow during the day. TARGET2 reports that the _average_ payment is settled within minutes of submission[\[34\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2020/html/ecb.ebart202005_03~4a20eae0c8.en.html#:~:text=25,CET%20and%2018%3A00%20CET%2C%20and), and operators pay attention to any unusual build-up of queues. Some systems even have rules or informal expectations to encourage steady throughput (the ECB noted that CHAPS participants "predominantly recycle liquidity" and have throughput guidelines in place)[\[25\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=significantly.,value%20within%20fixed%20time%20slots). We incorporate this aspect of real-world behavior by providing **public signals** in SimCash - for instance, a broadcast of the current Queue 2 size or the percentage of payments settled so far. Agents can use these signals to adjust their tactics (e.g. if they see the whole system is slowing down, they might decide to send payments more aggressively to avoid being caught in a bottleneck). This echoes how, in reality, if banks notice many payments piling up system-wide, they might act to resolve the gridlock (sometimes prompted by central bank alerts). Moreover, SimCash scenarios can include **operational disruptions** (e.g. temporarily pausing the LSM or reducing available credit) to test whether agents react in resilient ways, similar to how real institutions must have contingency plans if, say, the offsetting algorithm or some RTGS feature fails. By stressing the simulation in these ways, we verify that our model's outcomes remain plausible and that the agents' learned strategies don't exploit unrealistic loopholes absent in TARGET2's robust operational framework.

## Conclusion

By using TARGET2 as the model for SimCash's design, we embed into the simulation the same **rules, tools, and incentives** that real banks face in a modern RTGS environment. The simulator enforces immediate gross settlement with finality, offers collateralized intraday liquidity, and runs continuous liquidity-saving optimizations - all hallmark features of TARGET2[\[1\]](https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/sistema-pagamenti/target2/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1#:~:text=Payment%20orders%20are%20submitted%20to,limit%20on%20the%20transferable%20amount)[\[6\]](https://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/sistema-pagamenti/target2/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1#:~:text=T2%20enables%20efficient%20liquidity%20management,CLM%29%20service%20that). At the same time, banks (agents) in the simulation have the freedom to **manage payment timing and liquidity** much like actual TARGET2 participants do, delaying when prudent and coordinating payments to minimize cost[\[14\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2020/html/ecb.ebart202005_03~4a20eae0c8.en.html#:~:text=26,CET%20and%2018%3A00%20CET%2C%20and)[\[21\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=Incoming%20payments%20are%20considered%20to,are%20funded%20using%20the%20ICL). The result is a rich environment where phenomena observed in reality - from liquidity recycling and minimal credit usage[\[19\]](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202103_03~2e159cbd38.en.html#:~:text=In%20TARGET2%2C%20the%20main%20source,for%20TARGET2%20participants%20is%20low), to gridlock formation and resolution[\[13\]](https://www.nationalbanken.dk/media/r2xgriaj/2001-mon4-grid67.pdf#:~:text=Nationalbank%20www,the%20last%20few%20decades) - naturally emerge. This focus on realism means insights derived from SimCash (e.g. the impact of a policy change or a new liquidity tool) can be interpreted in the context of real-world RTGS behavior. In summary, grounding the simulator in TARGET2's design and practices ensures that **SimCash is not just a theoretical game, but a close proxy to real payment systems**, providing credible answers to "what if" questions about intraday liquidity and settlement dynamics in the banking world.
