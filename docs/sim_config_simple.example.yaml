# Simple Simulation Configuration (Without Automatic Arrivals)
#
# ⚠️  IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: Phase 5+ (not yet implemented)
#
# This document shows the TARGET configuration format for the payment simulator.
#
# Current Status (Phase 1-2): Basic models implemented, no API/orchestrator yet
# Phase 3 (planned): RTGS settlement engine
# Phase 4 (planned): LSM implementation
# Phase 5 (planned): Orchestrator + configuration loading
#
# This config will be usable once Phase 5 is complete.
