Posts full collateral at the start of the day and uses a very permissive, deadline-aware liquidity rule: release almost all payments early, holding back only the very largest non-urgent payments when liquidity is extremely tight. This prioritizes eliminating EOD unsettled transactions while retaining a thin liquidity buffer for robustness.",
