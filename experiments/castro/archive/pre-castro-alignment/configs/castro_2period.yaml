# Castro et al. (2025) - 2-Period Fixed Payment Scenario
# Replicates Section 6.3 for analytical validation
#
# Payment profiles (in cents):
#   Bank A: P^A = [0, 15000] - No period 1 outgoing, $150 in period 2
#   Bank B: P^B = [15000, 5000] - $150 in period 1, $50 in period 2
#
# Expected Nash Equilibrium:
#   Bank A: ℓ₀ = 0 (wait for incoming from B)
#   Bank B: ℓ₀ = 20000 (cover both periods)
#   Costs: R_A = 0, R_B = 2000 (0.1 * 20000)
