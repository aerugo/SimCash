# Experiment 2: 12-Period Stochastic
# LVTS-style realistic scenario with stochastic arrivals.
#
# Setup:
# - 12 ticks per day
# - Poisson arrivals, LogNormal amounts
# - Uses liquidity_pool mode (direct balance)
#
# Expected outcome: Both agents in 10-30% range

    This scenario tests a fundamental tradeoff in payment systems:
    - Allocating liquidity from the pool allows you to settle payments
    - But allocated liquidity has an opportunity cost

    The KEY DECISION in this scenario is: What fraction of the liquidity pool
    should be allocated at the START of the day?

    IMPORTANT: Focus your optimization on the `initial_liquidity_fraction` parameter.
    The payment_tree should remain a simple Release action - the real optimization
    is in how much liquidity to commit upfront.

    With a hard liquidity constraint (no overdraft allowed), you must have
    sufficient balance to settle each payment. Incoming payments from the
    counterparty provide liquidity that can be recycled for your outgoing payments.
