# Experiment 1: 2-Period Deterministic (Castro-Compliant)
# Validates Nash equilibrium with deferred crediting.
#
# Setup:
# - 2 ticks per day, 1 day
# - Deterministic payment arrivals
# - Uses liquidity_pool mode (direct balance) for Castro compliance
#
# Expected outcome: BANK_A = 0%, BANK_B = 20%
