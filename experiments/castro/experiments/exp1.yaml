# Experiment 1: 2-Period Deterministic
# Validates Nash equilibrium with deferred crediting.
#
# Setup:
# - 2 ticks per day, 1 day
# - Deterministic payment arrivals
# - Expected: Bank A posts 0, Bank B posts 20000
#
# Uses deterministic mode (single evaluation) since the scenario has
# no stochastic elements - all transactions are fixed at specific ticks.
