# Experiment 3: Joint Liquidity & Timing
# Optimizes both initial collateral AND payment timing jointly.
#
# Setup:
# - 3 ticks per day (evaluated over 10 ticks minimum)
# - Tests interaction between liquidity and timing decisions
# - 10 bootstrap samples for evaluation
#
# Note: Uses minimum evaluation_ticks of 10 for BootstrapConfig validation.
# The scenario runs 3 ticks per day, remaining ticks are idle.
