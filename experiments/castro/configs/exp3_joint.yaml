# Experiment 3: Three-Period Dummy Example (Joint Liquidity & Timing)
#
# Replicates Castro et al. (2025) Section 7.2:
# - P^A = P^B = [0.2, 0.2, 0] - symmetric payment demands
# - Joint learning of initial liquidity AND payment timing
# - Tests interaction between liquidity and timing decisions
#
# Expected outcome with r_c < r_d:
# - ~25% initial liquidity
# - ~10% payment delay (90% paid on time)

  # Castro paper requires: r_c < r_d < r_b
  # This is "Scenario 1: Liquidity cheaper than delay" (Figure 8)

  # r_c = 0.1 total over episode
  collateral_cost_per_tick_bps: 333
