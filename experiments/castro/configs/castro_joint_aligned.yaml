# Castro et al. (2025) - 3-Period Joint Learning Scenario (CASTRO-ALIGNED)
# Replicates Section 8: Learn both initial liquidity AND intraday timing
#
# CASTRO ALIGNMENT FEATURES ENABLED:
#   - deferred_crediting: true  (credits applied at end of tick)
#   - deadline_cap_at_eod: true (all deadlines capped at day end)
#   - LSM disabled (RTGS without netting, as per Castro model)
#
# CASTRO POLICY CONSTRAINTS (enforced by castro_mode=True in experiment script):
#   - Initial liquidity decision at t=0 ONLY (no mid-day collateral changes)
#   - Payment actions: Only Release (x_t=1) or Hold (x_t=0), no Split
#   - No ReleaseWithCredit (no interbank credit lines in Castro model)
#   - No reactive collateral tree (end_of_tick_collateral_tree)
#
# Symmetric payment profile: P = [20000, 20000, 0] for both banks
# Tests the liquidity-delay tradeoff in a balanced setting
#
# Key differences from previous runs:
#   1. Credits deferred to end of tick - no within-tick recycling
#   2. All deadlines capped at day end (tick 3)
#
# Expected behavior with deferred crediting:
#   - Cannot achieve zero-cost equilibrium through simultaneous recycling
#   - Must coordinate timing across ticks
#   - Higher initial liquidity likely needed

# Castro alignment features
deferred_crediting: true      # Credits applied at end of tick (Castro-compatible)
deadline_cap_at_eod: true     # All deadlines capped at day end

# Per-tick rates (Castro daily rates / 3)
cost_rates:
  # r_c (collateral): 0.1/day / 3 ticks = 333 bps/tick
  collateral_cost_per_tick_bps: 333

  delay_cost_per_tick_per_cent: 0.00067

  # r_b (overdraft): 0.4/day / 3 ticks = 1333 bps/tick
  overdraft_bps_per_tick: 1333

  # No hard penalties (Castro uses rate-based costs)
