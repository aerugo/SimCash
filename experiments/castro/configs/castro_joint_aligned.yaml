# Castro et al. (2025) - 3-Period Joint Learning Scenario (CASTRO-ALIGNED)
# Replicates Section 8: Learn both initial liquidity AND intraday timing
#
# CASTRO ALIGNMENT FEATURES ENABLED:
#   - deferred_crediting: true  (credits applied at end of tick)
#   - deadline_cap_at_eod: true (all deadlines capped at day end)
#   - LSM disabled (RTGS without netting, as per Castro model)
#
# CASTRO POLICY CONSTRAINTS (enforced by castro_mode=True in experiment script):
#   - Initial liquidity decision at t=0 ONLY (no mid-day collateral changes)
#   - Payment actions: Only Release (x_t=1) or Hold (x_t=0), no Split
#   - No ReleaseWithCredit (no interbank credit lines in Castro model)
#   - No reactive collateral tree (end_of_tick_collateral_tree)
#
# Symmetric payment profile: P = [20000, 20000, 0] for both banks
# Tests the liquidity-delay tradeoff in a balanced setting
#
# Key differences from previous runs:
#   1. Credits deferred to end of tick - no within-tick recycling
#   2. All deadlines capped at day end (tick 3)
#
# Expected behavior with deferred crediting:
#   - Cannot achieve zero-cost equilibrium through simultaneous recycling
#   - Must coordinate timing across ticks
#   - Higher initial liquidity likely needed

# Castro alignment features
deferred_crediting: true      # Credits applied at end of tick (Castro-compatible)
deadline_cap_at_eod: true     # All deadlines capped at day end

# Castro cost structure (see paper Section 6.2):
#   r_c = 0.1 (collateral opportunity cost, PER DAY - charged across all ticks)
#   r_d = 0.2 (delay cost, PER PERIOD - charged each tick a payment is held)
#   r_b = 0.4 (EOD borrowing cost, PER DAY - charged once at day end)
#
# CRITICAL: r_d is per-period, NOT per-day! Each tick a payment is held incurs
# 20% of its value as delay cost. This makes delay expensive to incentivize
# early payment.
cost_rates:
  # r_c: Collateral opportunity cost = 0.1/day
  # Divided across ticks: 0.1/3 = 0.0333 = 333 bps per tick
  collateral_cost_per_tick_bps: 333

  # r_d: Delay cost = 0.2 PER PERIOD (per tick)
  # NOT divided by ticks - each period of delay costs 20% of payment value
  delay_cost_per_tick_per_cent: 0.2

  # r_b: EOD borrowing = 0.4/day
  # Modeled as overdraft cost; divided by ticks: 0.4/3 = 0.133 = 1333 bps per tick
  # Note: Castro applies r_b once at EOD; SimCash charges per-tick while in overdraft
  overdraft_bps_per_tick: 1333

  # No hard penalties (Castro uses rate-based costs)
  eod_penalty_per_transaction: 0
  deadline_penalty: 0
  split_friction_cost: 0
  overdue_delay_multiplier: 1.0
