# Castro et al. (2025) - 2-Period Fixed Payment Scenario (CASTRO-ALIGNED)
# Replicates Section 6.3 for analytical validation
#
# CASTRO ALIGNMENT FEATURES ENABLED:
#   - deferred_crediting: true  (credits applied at end of tick)
#   - deadline_cap_at_eod: true (all deadlines capped at day end)
#   - LSM disabled (RTGS without netting, as per Castro model)
#
# CASTRO POLICY CONSTRAINTS (enforced by castro_mode=True in experiment script):
#   - Initial liquidity decision at t=0 ONLY (no mid-day collateral changes)
#   - Payment actions: Only Release (x_t=1) or Hold (x_t=0), no Split
#   - No ReleaseWithCredit (no interbank credit lines in Castro model)
#   - No reactive collateral tree (end_of_tick_collateral_tree)
#
# Payment profiles (in cents):
#   Bank A: P^A = [0, 15000] - No period 1 outgoing, $150 in period 2
#   Bank B: P^B = [15000, 5000] - $150 in period 1, $50 in period 2
#
# Expected Nash Equilibrium (with deferred crediting):
#   Bank A: l_0 = 0 (wait for incoming from B, available in period 2)
#   Bank B: l_0 = 20000 (cover both periods, since A can't recycle in period 1)
#   Costs: R_A = 0, R_B = 2000 (0.1 * 20000)
#
# Key difference from old experiments:
#   With deferred crediting, Bank A cannot use B's period-1 payment until period 2.
#   This should force the ASYMMETRIC equilibrium predicted by Castro.

# Castro cost structure (see paper Section 6.2):
#   r_c = 0.1 (collateral opportunity cost, PER DAY - charged across all ticks)
#   r_d = 0.2 (delay cost, PER PERIOD - charged each tick a payment is held)
#   r_b = 0.4 (EOD borrowing cost, PER DAY - charged once at day end)
#
# CRITICAL: r_d is per-period, NOT per-day! Each tick a payment is held incurs
# 20% of its value as delay cost. This makes delay expensive to incentivize
# early payment.
cost_rates:
  # r_c: Collateral opportunity cost = 0.1/day
  # Divided across ticks: 0.1/2 = 0.05 = 500 bps per tick
  collateral_cost_per_tick_bps: 500

  # r_d: Delay cost = 0.2 PER PERIOD (per tick)
  # NOT divided by ticks - each period of delay costs 20% of payment value
  delay_cost_per_tick_per_cent: 0.2

  # r_b: EOD borrowing = 0.4/day
  # Modeled as overdraft cost; divided by ticks: 0.4/2 = 0.2 = 2000 bps per tick
  # Note: Castro applies r_b once at EOD; SimCash charges per-tick while in overdraft
  overdraft_bps_per_tick: 2000
