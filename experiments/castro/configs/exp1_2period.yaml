# Experiment 1: 2-Period Deterministic (Castro-Compliant)
#
# Validates Nash equilibrium with deferred crediting.
# Expected outcome: Bank A posts 0%, Bank B posts 20%
#
# From Castro et al. (2025) Section 4.1
#
# CASTRO-COMPLIANT: Uses liquidity_pool mode (direct balance)
# instead of max_collateral_capacity (credit headroom).
