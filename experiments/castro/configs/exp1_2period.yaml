# Experiment 1: 2-Period Deterministic

# Validates Nash equilibrium with deferred crediting.
# Expected outcome: Bank A posts 0, Bank B posts 20000

  # Castro paper requires: r_c < r_d < r_b
  # r_c = collateral cost, r_d = delay cost, r_b = EOD borrowing cost
  #
  # Collateral cost: 500 bps per tick (r_c = 0.05 per tick)
  collateral_cost_per_tick_bps: 500
  # Delay cost: 0.1 per tick per cent (r_d = 0.10, must be > r_c)
  # This makes delaying a payment more expensive than posting collateral
